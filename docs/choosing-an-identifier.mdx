title: Choosing a Unique Identifier
---

MagicBell natively accepts emails and strings as unique identifiers for users, though the way you [send notifications](/docs/sending-notifications) to a user depends on how you identify users in your app. If your app allows users to update their email addresses, we recommend to use external IDs.

There are a number of benefits to choosing external ID over email as an identifier:

- External IDs are generally more robust, persistent, and can be linked to your app's DB records.
- Should a user's email address change in your system, you can update it in the same request to [create notifications](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification), removing the need to separately [update the email address](/docs/rest-api/reference#update-user).

<Note>If you use an integer to identify users, remember to cast it to a string.</Note>
