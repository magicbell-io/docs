## Server Side Rendering

Frameworks like Next.js and Remix, render your react components on the server before shipping them to the client. Our
React SDK does not offer support for server-side rendering at this moment. The work around is to prevent rendering on
the server, and only render MagicBell on the client.

```jsx
import MagicBell, { FloatingNotificationInbox}  from  "@magicbell/magicbell-react";

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {typeof window !== 'undefined' ? <MagicBell apiKey="..." userEmail="...">
        {(props) => <FloatingNotificationInbox {...props} />}
      </MagicBell> : null}
    </nav>
  )
}
```
