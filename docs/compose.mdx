subtitle: How to send a notification at app.magicbell.com
---

Sometimes you may not want to send notifications programmatically. Perhaps there's a product update to make all users aware of, or there's a promotion to send to a group of users. You can even test notifications by sending one-offs to yourself. 

The Compose feature is the way to send notifications using our application's interface instead of the API.

## Recipients
Enter the email addresses or external IDs of the desired recipients. 

Soon our team will release Announcements. You will be able to select All Users to send a notification to all users easily. 

<Note>
If the Announcements feature would be valuable for you - and you want to send notifications to all users as soon as possible - email hello@magicbell.com!
</Note>

## Notification Title
The title will be the subject of emails, and the first, bolded line for in-app notifications.

## Content
Content is the body of your notification - the message you want to pass onto users. Content will be the body of an email and below the notification title for in-app notifications.

The content input supports HTML. You can insert header, image, and other HTML tags.

## Action URL
Clicking the notification directs the user to the action URL.
