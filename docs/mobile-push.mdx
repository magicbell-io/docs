MagicBell can help you implement mobile push notifications in four steps.

1. [Setup iOS (APNS) notifications](/docs/mobile-push/ios)
2. [Setup Android (Firebase) notifications](/docs/mobile-push/android)

## Configure your mobile app

Good, your credentials are set! However, you still need to configure your app.

If you are developing your app with [Expo](https://expo.io) or any other [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) library we recommend using
[this React Native library](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification). Here you have a short example:

```jsx title=React-Native
import PushNotification from 'react-native-push-notification';
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Alert, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    PushNotification.createChannel({
      channelId: 'default-channel-id',
      channelName: 'Default channel',
      soundName: 'default',
      vibrate: true,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>welcome to MagicBell</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

PushNotification.configure({
  onNotification: (notification) => {
    Alert.alert(notification.title, notification.message);
  },
  requestPermissions: true,
});
```

If you face any issues while configuring the library, please feel free to shoot us a note, we will be happy to help.
You might also find it helpful to read the [full React Native example](https://github.com/magicbell-io/react-native-notifications-example) we created.

This is a sample payload MagicBell will push to your app:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "id": "7fb3ce9f-a866-4dff-8ce8-2f64f7c5ed4c",
    "title": "Pickup Instructions â€“ In-Store",
    "action_url": "https://magicbell.com/pricing",
    "content": "<ul><li>Bring your valid government-issued photo ID.</li></ul>",
    "category": "order_ready",
    "custom_attributes": {
      "order_number": "W846MD",
      "part_number": "MRJL74/C"
    }
  }
}
```

If you set [overrides](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification) for the `mobile_push` channel, those values will be pushed to your app.

## Forward device tokens to MagicBell

Both Android and iOS will generate a registration token when someone installs your app on their
device. Please retrieve it and forward it to MagicBell.

```jsx title=React-Native
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import PushNotification from 'react-native-push-notification';

PushNotification.configure({
  onRegister: (token) => {
    fetch('https://api.magicbell.com/push_subscriptions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'X-MAGICBELL-API-KEY': MAGICBELL_API_KEY,
        'X-MAGICBELL-USER-EXTERNAL-ID': CURRENT_USER_ID,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        push_subscription: {
          device_token: token,
          platform: Platform.OS,
        },
      }),
    });
  },
  requestPermissions: true,
});
```

Keep in mind that a new device token will be generated when the user
reinstalls the app or clears the app data. Therefore, you will have to forward
the new token to MagicBell each time a new one is generated.

Now MagicBell will deliver mobile push notifications when you create notifications
through [the create notifications API endpoint](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification)!
