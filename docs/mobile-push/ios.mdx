To deliver push notifications from your iOS app you need to register a new auth key
for the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). MagicBell will use P8
tokens to authenticate requests made to the APNs.

Follow these steps to register a new key:

1. Login to [your Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and open the keys page (you have to enroll in Apple's Developer Program, before).
1. Register a new key, make sure you enable "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)"
1. Apple will generate a 10-digit ID and an authentication token signing key. Store it safely.

To configure iOS mobile push notifications for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

1. From the **Channels** page in your Dashboard, click the âš™ icon next to **Mobile Push** to access Mobile Push Channel Settings.
1. Under **APNs**, enable the provider and complete the required fields, then click **Save**.

MagicBell needs the P8 key ID, team ID for your Apple account, P8 cert, and the iOS app's bundle ID.
