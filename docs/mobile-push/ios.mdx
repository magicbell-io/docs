subtitle: Setup iOS (APNS) notifications on MagicBell

To deliver push notifications from your iOS app you need to register a new auth key
for the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and send it to us. MagicBell will use p8
tokens to authenticate requests made to the APNs.

Follow these steps to register a new key:

- Login to [your Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and open the keys page (you have to enroll in Apple's Developer Program, before).
- Register a new key, make sure you enable "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)"
- Apple will generate a 10-digit ID and an authentication token signing key. Store it safely.

MagicBell needs the p8 key, ID, team ID for your Apple account, and iOS app's bundle ID. Please
[get in touch with us](mailto:hello@magicbell.com) so we can help you set them up for your account.
