subtitle: Setup Android (Firebase) Notifications on MagicBell
---

To deliver push notifications from your Android app you need to create a Firebase
project and set your [Firebase credentials](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server) for MagicBell.
Follow these steps to do it:

- Login to your [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com), pick your project and open the settings page of that project. If you don't have a project yet, create one.
- Open the Cloud Messaging settings tab, copy the server key and sender ID.

MagicBell needs the project's server key, sender ID, and the bundle ID of your Android app. Please [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@magicbell.com) so we can help you set them up for your account.
