## Two options
- Using the UI
- Programatically

## The UI

The compose feature can send notifications to individuals, a group of users, or all users. To send a notification to all users:

### 1) Click on the Compose button in the sidebar


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/SidebarCompose.png"
  style={{ width: '5%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


### 2) Select Everyone in To


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/ComposeButton.jpg"
  style={{ width: '80%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


Now all users will receive the notification! 

<i>After clicking Everyone, you may notice <a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/categories">Category</a> toggles to Announcement. Assigning notifications a Category is a great way to customize your inbox and derive insights from analytics down the road.</i>

## Programatically

A notification can be sent to all users by including the "matches" attribute with the "email" key, leaving the value an empty string.

```shell hideHeader
{
  matches: [
    {
      "email": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to Manage Users 

You can view, add, and delete users on our Users page. If you send an announcement, it will be delivered to the users listed on this page.
