## Two options
- Using the UI
- Programatically

## The UI

The compose feature can send notifications to individuals, a group of users, or all users. To send a notification to all users:

### 1) Click on the Compose button in the sidebar


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/SidebarCompose.png"
  style={{ width: '5%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


### 2) Select Everyone in To


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/ComposeButton.jpg"
  style={{ width: '80%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


Now all users will receive the notification! 

<i>After clicking Everyone, you may notice <a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/categories">Category</a> toggles to Announcement. Assigning notifications a Category is a great way to customize your inbox and derive insights from analytics down the road.</i>

## Programmatically

All users can receive a notification by including the "matches" attribute with the "email" key, leaving the value an empty string.

```shell hideHeader
{
  matches: [
    {
      "email": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to manage users 

Our team built a page specifically to view, add, and delete users. These are the users who will receive a notification. If a user has not logged onto your site since implementing MagicBell - and they should receive an announcement - you must manually add them.
