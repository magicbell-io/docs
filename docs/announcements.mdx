title: Announcements
subtitle: How to send a notification to all users
---

## Two options
- Programatically
- Using the UI

## Programmatically

All users can receive a notification by using [Segmented Send](https://magicbell.com/docs/segmented-send). In `notification.recipients`, include the `matches` attribute with a `*` as the value. Now, all users will receive the notification!

```shell hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We are processing your order",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "matches": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The UI

To send a notification to all users, simply open Compose, click Recipients, and select Everyone.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/AnnouncementCompose.png"
  style={{ width: '75%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

## FAQ: Can you be more specific when you say <i>all</i> users receive announcements?

An announcement will be sent to all users who have logged into your application and used MagicBell, or recieved a notification in the past. Otherwise, we do not know the user exists.  

### Sync your users

Make sure your users are synced with MagicBell by using our [create users API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-user) to add a user each time one is added to your system.
