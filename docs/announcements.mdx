subtitle: How to send a notification to all users
---

<Note>
  Announcements can be sent programatically, but the Compose functionality is currently in development. Email hello@magicbell.com if you want this feature as soon as possible!
</Note>

## Two options
- Programatically
- Using the UI

## Programmatically

All users can receive a notification by using [Segmented Send](https://magicbell.com/docs/segmented-send). In `notification.recipients`, include the `matches` attribute with a `*` as the value. Now, all users will receive the notification!

```shell hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We are processing your order",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "matches": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The UI (Coming soon!)

The compose feature can send notifications to individuals, a group of users, or all users. To send a notification to all users:

### 1) Click on the Compose button in the sidebar


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/SidebarCompose.png"
  style={{ width: '5%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


### 2) Select Everyone in To


<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/ComposeButton.jpg"
  style={{ width: '80%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>


Now all users will receive the notification! 

<i>After clicking Everyone, you may notice <a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/categories">Category</a> toggles to Announcement. Assigning notifications a Category is a great way to customize your inbox and derive insights from analytics down the road.</i>
