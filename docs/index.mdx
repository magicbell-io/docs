/>

### JavaScript

Developers can change the styling directly in code as well.

```html title=ESM
<script type="module">
  import { renderWidget } from 'https://assets.magicbell.com/magicbell.esm.js';

  let theme = {
    icon: { borderColor: 'white', width: '20px' },
    header: { backgroundColor: '#7fccc4', textColor: '#f2faf9' },
    footer: { backgroundColor: '#7fccc4', textColor: '#f2faf9' },
  };

  magicbell('render', target, {
    apiKey: 'MAGICBELL_API_KEY',
    userEmail: 'mary@example.com',
    height: 500,
    theme,
  });
</script>
```

### React

Our team built two React libraries to give you more power! An example is the
ability to completely customize the in-app notification inbox to match the
design of your product. See our [theming guide](https://magicbell.com/docs/react/theme-customization) and the
[package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react) to
learn more.

## Our Vision with MagicBell

Our goal is for customers to have a notification system as fast as possible - in
under 30 mins - and continue to wow day after day. We vow to continue to make
MagicBell a more powerful tool without compromising ease of use.

Building a notification system in-house is hard! There's a lot of complexity and
a wide breadth of features needed: the in-app experience, multiple channels
(email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, branding, and more.

MagicBell takes care of all the work, so you never have to think about
notifications again! ðŸ™‚
