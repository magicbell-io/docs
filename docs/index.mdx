### MagicBell Application

At [app.magicbell.com/projects](https://app.magicbell.com/projects) you can change colors, typography, and additional styling. You must then copy the code in 'Notification Inbox Code' and paste the updated code into your application.

### React SDK

Our team built a ReactSDK to give you more power! An example is the ability to completely customize the in-app notification inbox to match the design of your product. See our [ReactSDK documentation](https://magicbell.com/docs/react/theme-customization) and the [React package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react) to learn more!

## Vision Going Forward
Our goal is for customers to have a notification system as fast as possible - in under 30 mins - and continue to wow day after day. We vow to continue to make MagicBell a more powerful tool without compromising ease of use.

Building a notification system in-house is hard! There's a lot of complexity and a wide breadth of features needed: the in-app experience, multiple channels (email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, branding, and more. 

MagicBell takes care of all the work, so you never have to think about notifications again! ðŸ™‚
