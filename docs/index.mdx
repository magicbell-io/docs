## The MagicBell Way

Our goal is for customers to have a notification system as fast as possible - in
under 30 mins - and continue to wow day after day. We vow to continue to make
MagicBell a more powerful tool without compromising ease of use.

Building a notification system in-house is hard! There's a lot of complexity and
a wide breadth of features needed: the in-app experience, multiple channels
(email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, branding, and more.

MagicBell takes care of all the work, so you never have to think about
notifications again! ðŸ™‚
