subtitle: How to view and debug sent notifications
---

Log is a real-time tool in the [MagicBell dashboard](https://app.magicbell.com) that helps you confirm and debug notifications sent using the [API](https://www.magicbell.com/docs/graphql-api/overview) or [Compose](https://www.magicbell.com/docs/compose). It is a great way to test your implementation to validate notifications are being sent successfully and arriving to your destination.

With Log, you can view granular metadata for each notification sent, including those sent from other [providers](https://www.magicbell.com/docs/email/3rd-party-email-providers) such as [SendGrid](https://www.magicbell.com/docs/email/sendgrid), Apple Push Notification service (APNs), etc. Example data included in Logs is the response status code, request body, response body, ID, channel, recipient, and more!
