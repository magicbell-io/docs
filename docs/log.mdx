subtitle: How to view and debug sent notifications

Log is a real-time tool that helps you confirm and debug notifications sent using the API or Compose. It is a great way to test your implementation to validate notifications are being sent successfully and arriving to your destination.

With Log, you can view granular metadata for each notification sent, including the response status code, request body, and response body.
