## API

API stands for _application programming interface_. It is a set of definitions
and protocols for building and integrating application software.
You can read more about APIs at [RedHat's article on APIs](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces).

To send notifications to your users, use MagicBell's REST API.
We also offer wrappers for some programming languages that simplify the
communication with our API. You can read the complete [REST API reference](/docs/rest-api/reference) to know more about our API.

## Component

This is a term used to refer to any user interface element packaged
for distribution. Components let you split the user interface into reusable
pieces. MagicBell provides you with several components so you can customize
your UI as much as you want.

## Dashboard

Your MagicBell dashboard is the place where you can configure and
customize your MagicBell experience. It's accessible at https://app.magicbell.com.
You can also set up billing, configure delivery channels and keep a tab on your
usage.

## HMAC

In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash
message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code) is a
specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic
hash function and a secret cryptographic key. As with any MAC, it may be used
to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a
message.

Here is the definition from [Wikipedia's article on HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

## Monthly active users (MAU)

The number of users that fetch MagicBell notifications in your
site, whether you notified them or not, in a month.

## Notification inbox

The notification inbox sits at the heart of the MagicBell experience
for you and your users. We built it to be lightweight, responsive, and real-time.
We also offer you toolkits to build custom client-side interfaces without
having to start from scratch.

## Notifications

Notifications come in many shapes and forms, and we love that!
What you may call a notification, your co-worker may call an update, while some
others may think of it as an activity. In our view, all of the following are
notifications:

- A lead responded to your offer.
- Your friend tagged you in a comment.
- Your account balance just went negative.
- We just released a new feature!

On a more philosophical level, a notification is a pointer to something
important. It could be a pointer to an update your users need to pay attention
to or an item they need to work on. You can send a notification to one user or
to a group of user. For example, as a SaaS software provider, you'd want to
send billing related notifications to all the users from an organization.

## User

Users are people that you send notifications to. They are
your customers - the users of your product. MagicBell bills you based on the
number of monthly active users (MAU).

Users can be [identified](/docs/choosing-an-identifier) by their email address or any other ID coming from your
system (we call it `external_id`).
