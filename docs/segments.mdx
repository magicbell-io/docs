subtitle: Learn how to group your users into segments

Often notifications need to be sent to a specified group of users. Groups can be static, but more commonly, they are dynamic (e.g., when a user switches payment tiers). Select Segments as recipients when using [Compose](/docs/compose) to send notifications to your users.

## How to create segments

Click the **Users** icon from the left navigation sidebar and select **Create Segment**. Use the query builder to compose a new segment. Segments consist of a **Field**, a **Condition**, and **Criteria**. Matches will display below the query builder as you build the segment.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/create-segment.gif"
  style={{ width: '75%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

Compose complex segments by creating additional filters â€” click **Add** and choose the `And` or `Or` operator.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/create-complex-segment.gif"
  style={{ width: '75%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

Remember to label and save your segment!

<Note>
Segment labels do not have to be unique.

### Fields

The following fields are supported:

- `email`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `external_id`
- `custom_attributes`

Custom Attributes can also consist of:

- nested properties (`nested.property`)
- deeply nested properties (`deeply.nested.property`)
- arrays (`["dog", "cat", "rabbit"]`)

### Conditions

The following conditions are supported:

- `contains`
- `equals`
- `starts with`
- `ends with`

### Criteria

- Criteria accepts strings and integers under 200 characters, and boolean values.
- `*` is a wild card. It represents any character. For example, `s*nk` matches "sink", "sank", and "sunk".

## Setting custom attributes

We encourage you to set custom
attributes on your MagicBell users to take full advantage of this feature. You can do it using our [users API endpoints](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-user).
