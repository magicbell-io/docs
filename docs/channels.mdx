MagicBell delivers notifications to:

- Inbox
- [Email](/docs/email/3rd-party-email-providers)
- Web push
- [Mobile push](/docs/react-native/implement-mobile-push-notifications#setup-android-push-notifications)
- [Slack](/docs/slack)
- SMS

The channels page of your [MagicBell dashboard](https://app.magicbell.com)
provides the option to configure which channels all notifications within a
project are delivered to.

## User Preferences

You can allow users to control which channels they receive notifications to.
Check the [user preferences API](/docs/rest-api/reference#get-preferences) for
futher information.

Our UI libraries offer a preferences pane. It allows users to toggle the
channels they prefer for each category.

## In-app

We believe having an in-app notification inbox is a crucial component for most
applications - otherwise we would not exist! In-app notifications drive
engagement, provide a better user experience, and allow applications to drive
user awareness of key events and functionality. The in-app inbox is the starting
point for MagicBell customers and users.

## Email

Deliver notifications to email addresses directly from MagicBell. HTML can be
used directly in the Content input to customize emails. There are also extensive
integration options with SendGrid, Postmark, and Mailgun!

## Mobile push

Push notifications are often a crucial component of mobile applications.

## Web push

Push notifications for the web are a great way to reach users working on desktop
machines instantly. A good reminder is users must enable desktop notifications.

## Slack

Reach your users with Slack notifications powered by MagicBell. MagicBell supports
both webhook and oauth Slack apps to allow you all the control you need.

## SMS

SMS notifications help you deliver notifications to all your users, even those
in places with no internet, or those with internet that still like a little old
fashioned touch :)
