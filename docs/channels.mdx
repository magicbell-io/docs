## In-app
We believe having an in-app notification inbox is a crucial component for most applications - otherwise we would not exist! In-app notifications drive engagement, provide a better user experience, and allow applications to drive user awareness of key events and functionality. The in-app inbox is the starting point for MagicBell customers and users.

## Email
Deliver notifications to email addresses directly from MagicBell. HTML can be used directly in the Content input to customize emails. There are also extensive integration options with SendGrid, Postmark, and Mailgun!

## Mobile push
Push notifications are often a crucial component of mobile applications.  

## Web push
Push notifications for the web are a great way to reach users working on desktop machines instantly. A good reminder is users must enable desktop notifications.
