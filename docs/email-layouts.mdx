Email Layouts are a great way to decouple the rendering of a notification from the data that powers it. Email Layouts are global and apply to all notifications sent through the email channel.

## How to compose email layouts

Please visit the Channels tab in the dashboard, then select Email Layout. Here, copy/paste the HTML of your current email template. Use the merge tag `{{ template.content }}` as a placeholder for the content. The content will default to `{{ notification.content }}` for uncategorized notifications and categories without configured templates.

This layout will wrap around all notifications sent to the email channel.

<img
  className="full-mobile"
  src="/docs/uploads/email-layout.png"
  style={{ width: '75%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

At this time, one email layout can be configured per project.
