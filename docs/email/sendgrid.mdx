## Sending SendGrid emails from MagicBell's API

### Initial setup

- Sign up for SendGrid and obtain an API key
- Email your **API key** (with full access to the Mail Send endpoint) and your **from address from a verified sender identity** to hello@magicbell.com

### Sending emails

**No additional work is needed to send an email through SendGrid**. Your account is set up after emailing our team the necessary information. Now, emails sent through MagicBell's API will use SendGrid. You can verify your team sent an email in SendGrid's application.

### Sending emails with additional or unique content

The `overrides` attribute can send additional and differing content from other channels.

`Overrides` accepts the attributes directly from [SendGrid's documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send). Below is an example of declaring a unique subject line for emails.

```shell hideHeader
"notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [{
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
    }],
    "overrides": {
        "providers": {
            "sendgrid": {
                "subject": "New subject header"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Using SendGrid email templates

After creating a template in SendGrid, copy the template ID. Then add the template_id attribute to `overrides`. You can also pass custom data for SendGrid templates into the `custom_attributes` attribute. Below is an example showing how to add a specific user's name to a SendGrid template with a custom subject line.

```shell hideHeader
"notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [{
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
    }],
    "custom_attributes": {
        "name": "Dan"
    }
    "overrides": {
        "providers": {
            "sendgrid": {
                "subject": "New subject header",
                "template_id": "paste template id here"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
