## Deliver email notifications with your Mailgun account

To have Mailgun configured for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

- Sign up for Mailgun and obtain an API key
- Send us your API key and sending domain (encrypt it with our [public PGP key](/docs/uploads/magicbell-support.key))
- Verify the email channel in MagicBell is enabled

You can also set the name and email of the sender of all email notifications.

Once your account is set up, MagicBell will automatically deliver email notifications through your Mailgun account, **no
additional work is needed**.

## Sending emails with additional or unique content

Our [create notifications endpoint](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification)
allows you to customize the content sent to Postmark by setting
[`notification.overrides`](https://magicbell.com/docs/overrides).

The `notification.overrides` parameter accepts all of the [Mailgun's Messages API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html#sending)
body parameters.

Below is an example of a tagged message with custom headers.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We're processing your order",
    "content": "<p>Thank you for your order. We'll notify you when these items are ready.</p>",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@example.com"
      }
    ],
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "mailgun": {
          "o:tag": "onboarding",
          "h:X-Original-To": "devs@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using Mailgun email templates

MagicBell can deliver email notifications using Mailgun email templates.

Create a template in Mailgun, and grab its ID. Then create a notification with the `template` attribute set in
`notification.overrides.providers.mailgun`. MagicBell will use `custom_attributes` to fill in your template.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We're processing your order",
    "content": "<p>Thank you for your order. We'll notify you when these items are ready.</p>",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@example.com"
      }
    ],
    "custom_attributes": {
      "name": "Dan",
      "company_name": "Example Inc"
    },
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "mailgun": {
          "template": "incident_report"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
