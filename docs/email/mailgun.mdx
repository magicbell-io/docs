## Sending Mailgun emails from MagicBell's API

### Initial setup

- Sign up for Mailgun and obtain an API key
- ✉️ Email your **API key**, **sending domain**, and (optionally) what you wish the name and email of the sender to display as to hello@magicbell.com
- Verify the emails channel in MagicBell is enabled

### Sending emails

**No additional work is needed to send an email through Mailgun**. Your account is set up after emailing our team the necessary information. Now, emails sent through MagicBell's API will use Mailgun. You can verify your team sent an email in Mailgun's application.

### Sending emails with additional or unique content

The `overrides` attribute allows you to send content unique to email, differing from other channels.

`Overrides` accept the exact attributes directly from [Mailgun's documentation](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html#sending). Below is an example of a notification with an email subject line different from the title of other channels.

```shell hideHeader
"notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [{
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
    }],
    "overrides": {
        "providers": {
            "mailgun": {
                "subject": "New subject header"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Mailgun email templates

After creating a template in Mailgun, copy the template ID. Then add the `template` attribute to `overrides`. You can also pass custom data for Mailgun templates into the `custom_attributes` attribute. It's possible to override `custom_attributes` by using [h:X-Mailgun-Variables](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#templates), but we recommend sticking to `custom_attributes`! Below is an example showing how to add a specific user's name to a Mailgun template with a custom subject line.

```shell hideHeader
"notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [{
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
    }],
    "custom_attributes": {
        "name": "Dan"
    }
    "overrides": {
        "providers": {
            "mailgun": {
                "subject": "New subject header",
                "template_id": "paste template id here"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
