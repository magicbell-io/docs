## Deliver email notifications with your Postmark account

To configure Postmark for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for [Postmark](https://account.postmarkapp.com/sign_up) and [obtain a server API token](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1008-what-are-the-account-and-server-api-tokens).
1. Verify your sender signature in Postmark.
1. From the **Channels** page in your Dashboard, click the âš™ icon next to **Email** to access Email Channel Settings.
1. Under **Postmark**, enable the provider and enter the API key from step 1 then click **Save**.

<Note>
You can optionally configure a custom from email address (verified sender signature) and name.
</Note>

Once your account is set up, MagicBell will automatically deliver email
notifications through your Postmark account, **no additional work is needed**.

Please keep in mind that MagicBell automatically injects both `notification_id`
and `broadcast_id` in the metadata of messages sent to Postmark.

## Sending emails with additional or unique content

Our [create notifications endpoint](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification)
allows you to customize the content sent to Postmark by setting
[`notification.overrides`](/docs/overrides).

The `notification.overrides` parameter accepts all of the body parameters of
[Postmark's Email API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api).

Below is an example of a tagged message with custom headers.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "signup",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@example.com"
      }
    ],
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "postmark": {
          "Tag": "signup",
          "Headers": {
            "X-Original-To": "devs@example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
