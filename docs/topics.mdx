subtitle: Groups notifications about one topic

Topics are a way to group together notifications about a specific entity in your system. You can use them for different kinds of orders,
posts, documents, interests, etc. Let's use GitHub as an example. An example category is `comment`. Users comment on
various kinds of activity - one example being pull requests. The topic in this example is a specific pull-request. Therefore,
you can create a notification with the topic `pull-request-{{id}}` (`pull-request-123` for the pull request with ID 123).

## Creating notifications for a topic

When creating a notification, you can set a topic in the `notification.topic` parameter. A topic must contain
less than 256 characters and should not contain spaces. An example is below.

```json hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Your Account Needs Some Attention",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "josue@magicbell.io",
        "external_id": "00001"
      }
    ],
    "topic": "pull-request-123",
    "category": "comment"
  }
}
```

## Fetching notifications for a topic

Topics help with fetching all notifications for a specific entity in your system.
For example, you may want to show all notifications about a specific order in your UI.
You can use our Rest API or GraphQL endpoint to fetch all notifications for a topic by supplying the topic query param.
You can also mark all notifications for a topic `read` in one API call.
