## September 6, 2021

### React SDK v2.0.0

The team [introduced a number of enhancements](https://github.com/magicbell-io/react-headless/releases), including eliminating the need to wrap components with the observer function.

### Postmark integration

You can now send a notification using MagicBell's API through your Postmark account. 

To get started, mail your Postmark API key to hello@magicbell.com. Then include the snippet of code below in your API call. 

```shell hideHeader
"overrides": {
	"providers": {
	    "postmark": { 
			"from": {"email": "ENTER EMAIL ADDRESS"}
  		}
	}
}
```

We also include SendGrid and Mailgun.

### Enhanced integration with delivery providers

MagicBell can now relay extra attributes to your providers when calling their API. All you need to do is to send us a provider-specific override when using the create notification API. This is helpful when you want to leverage extra functionality offered by your providers, For example, MagicBell email notifications can leverage SendGrid templates using overrides. See our [demo video for SendGrid](https://www.loom.com/share/c650fa66bd78429d8a90058d704943e0) to learn how.

## August 16, 2021

### Sidebar redesign

Our team is thrilled to introduce the [updated sidebar](https://app.magicbell.com/projects)!

### React SDK v8

V8 got rid of MobX, fixed an assortment of bugs, and changed to a proprietary license (vs MIT). It will also support multiple notification lists, which is coming soon!


## July 2021

### **Filter notifications by category**

We've added support for filtering notifications by category. You might find it useful to add tabs to your notification inbox. Please check theÂ [fetch notifications API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#get-notifications)Â endpoint documentation for details. Support is coming soon for the React SDK.

### **#2 on Hacker News**

Mila - MagicBellâ€™s designer - wrote aÂ [great blog post](https://magicbell.com/blog/what-painting-taught-me-about-a-career-in-ui-design)Â on her journey from being an artist to a UI designer. The post skyrocketed all the way to #2 on Hacker News, generating 110+ comments.

### **Edit and delete projects**

After a project is created, it can be edited and / or deleted.

### **Idempotent requests**

TheÂ [API now supports idempotency](https://magicbell.com/docs/idempotent-requests)Â for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response.

### **New Slack community**

[We created a Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/magicbell-community/shared_invite/zt-trh6yi84-~jtPqNikvC1m3My_p0WUqw)Â for the MagicBell community. We hope itâ€™s a helpful resource to answer questions, give product updates, and more!


## June 2021

### **Compose button**

We rolled out a compose button in our dashboard that lets you send notifications to your users. You can add multiple email addresses or external IDs. 

### **Postmark integration**

We've added support for delivering email notifications via Postmark. If you'd like it setup, please contact us. We'll roll out integrations to our dashboard in the coming months, but we are happy to set them up for you in the meantime. . We also support Mailgun and SendGrid.

### **Multiple mobile-push apps per project**

We've added support for multiple push apps per project. This is useful if you use different app bundles for test/canary/production. Please see theÂ [updated documentation](https://magicbell.com/docs/api-reference#operation/create-push-subscription)Â or write us if you Â have any questions.


## May 2021

### **Improved developer documentation site**

OurÂ [new documentation site](https://www.hoss.com/)Â went live last week. It's more readable, features better navigation, and allows us to add live examples (coming soon!). We'd love to hear your feedback on the structure, and the content.

### **Goodbye Mobx. Welcome smaller React package!**

This month we also worked to remove MobX from our react packages. We replaced it with a new library calledÂ [Valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio), which allows us to keep the API reactive while reducing the package size. You can try out the beta version of theÂ [@magicbell/magicbell-react package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react/v/8.0.0-beta.3). The bundle size is 50% smaller, and customers who use MobX can use MagicBell without any possible conflicts. Furthermore, this release is fully backward compatible as the API of our components hasnâ€™t changed one bit!

We'll be updating our embeddable, and shipping this improvement to the stable branch in the coming weeks.

### **Push subscription API**

We have documented theÂ [push subscription API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#tag/Subscription-to-push-notifications-APIs)Â that you can use for both web & mobile push subscriptions. If you'd like to offer mobile push notifications, please contact us, and we'll help you get started.


## April 2021

### **User deletion API**

We added anÂ [API endpoint](https://developer.magicbell.com/reference#delete_users-user-id)Â for cases when a user deletes their account and you want to remove them from MagicBell for GDPR compliance.

### **Web push notifications for Safari**

We launched web-push last month but it took us a little longer to get to web-push for Safari. Apple has their own (harder) way of doing everything so it took us a while to get this out the door. We'll write up a blog about this soon.

**New status page and Twitter**

We launched aÂ [better status page](https://status.magicbell.com/)Â (that lets you subscribe for email updates) as well as a dedicatedÂ [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicBellStatus)Â for status updates. We'd still love for you to follow our regularÂ [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicBell_io)Â too, of-course! :)

**iOS push beta**

iOS push is now in beta and we'd love for you to try it out. Please reply to this email if you are interested. Android beta coming up next!


## March 2021

### **Notification preferences beta**

TheÂ [6.27.0-beta.1 version of the React package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react/v/6.27.0-beta.1)Â offers a notification preferences UI. We'd love for you to try it and give us some feedback. If you add categories to yourÂ [POST /notifications API](https://developer.magicbell.io/reference#notification-send-api)Â calls, we'll render the preferences matrix for your users - automagically. You can see it in action on ourÂ [Chrome extension for Hacker news](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-news-notifications/bbkfblhdgiddlkfkipjdhhfoephonoba?hl=en&authuser=0)Â (which is pretty awesome, by the way).

![https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/316735864/a0a69ef592ef9ebfb584254a/image.png](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/316735864/a0a69ef592ef9ebfb584254a/image.png)

This is how the UI looks when we use categoriesÂ *direct_comment, reply,*Â andÂ *new_message,*Â and enable the web push channel for our project.

### **React headless SDK**

A lot of you asked for better React Native support. We just released aÂ [React headless library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/react-headless)Â that contains a set of React headless components and hooks to build a notification inbox in React or React Native. Our official React package has more bells and whistles, but this new library is an excellent option for the more adventurous (or creative) ones! Here is anÂ [example in React Native](https://codesandbox.io/s/ancient-frost-roln4). A full blown React Native library will soon follow.
