MagicBell's notification inbox is a beautifully designed and highly functional in-app experience for your users that you can add to your product quickly and effortlessly.

The core components of our Inbox are

- A list of notifications with real-time updates
- Notification preference management
- State management and actions for notifications (mark as read/unread, and delete)
- Banner for opting into web-push (on supported browsers)

Apart from offering the Inbox, we also provide access to lower-level components that you can use to build a custom inbox. Please take a look at [API wrappers and libraries](/docs/libraries-api-wrappers)
