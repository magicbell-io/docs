Templates are a great way to decouple the rendering of a notification from the data that powers it. Templates are composed on a per category, per channel basis.

## How to compose templates

Please visit the Categories tab in the dashboard. Select your desired category (or create a new one), then switch to the Templates tab. Here, you can create or edit templates for each channel by selecting from the dropdown.

  style={{ width: '75%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

Templates override the title and content of notifications.

Merge tags such as `{{ notification.content }}` are supported — a complete list will appear when you press `{`, after which you can continue typing or select one from the list.

More advanced functionality such as [control flow](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/) and [default values](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/default/) are also supported — consult the [Liquid reference](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) more information.

[Notification Overrides](/docs/overrides) further override the title and content of templates.

### Notification title

The title will be the subject of email and push notifications and the first bolded line for in-app and Slack notifications.

### Content

Content is the body of your notification - the message you want to pass on to users. Content will be the body of an email and below the notification title for in-app notifications.

The content input supports HTML and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Limitations

- Templates work across channels subject to limitations for that channel. For instance, Slack does not support headings.
- Channel-specific styling notes:
  - **In-app and email**: Markdown converts to HTML, which is then sent to the user.
  - **Slack**: HTML is sent as raw text. Markdown is not parsed prior to sending the notification — rather, any Markdown will be parsed by Slack.
  - **Push and SMS**: Markdown is removed. As with Slack, HTML is sent as raw text.
