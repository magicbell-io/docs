Templates are a great way to decouple the rendering of a notification from the data that powers it. Templates are composed on a per category, per channel basis.

## How to compose templates

Please visit the Categories tab in the dashboard. Select your desired category (or create a new one), then switch to the Templates tab. Here, you can create or edit templates for each channel by selecting from the dropdown.

  src="/docs/uploads/templates.png"
  style={{ width: '80%', height: 'intrinsic' }}
/>

Merge tags such as `{{ notification.content }}` are supported — a complete list will appear when you press `{`, after which you can continue typing or select one from the list. More advanced functionality such as [control flow](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/) and [default values](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/default/) are also supported — consult the [Liquid reference](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) more information.

### Notification title

The title will be the subject of emails, and the first bolded line for in-app
notifications.

### Content

Content is the body of your notification - the message you want to pass on to users. Content will be the body of an email and below the notification title for in-app notifications.

The content input supports [HTML](https://html-online.com/editor/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Email Layout

Please visit the Channels tab in the dashboard, then select Email Layout. Here, copy/paste the HTML of your current email template. Use the merge tag `{{ template.content }}` as a placeholder for the content. The content will default to `{{ notification.content }}` for uncategorized notifications and categories without configured templates.

All notifications that are sent to the email channel will be wrapped in this layout.

## Limitations

- Templates work across channels subject to limitations for that channel. For instance, Slack does not support headings.
