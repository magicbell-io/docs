subtitle: Enable users to manage their notification preferences & control delivery channels

When creating a notification, you can send in a `category`. They help with:

## Controlling delivery channels

By default, notifications are delivered to the channels enabled for the project.
However, if you'd like notifications of a specific category to be delivered to fewer channels, we can enable that for you. Please write to us.

For example, in a Google docs-like application, you may send the 'page updated' notification only in-app, not via email or mobile push.
To accomplish this in MagicBell, you can use the category update and write to us to disable email and mobile-push channels for this category.

## End-user notification preference management

Notification preferences for a user are set per category.
For example, in the screenshot below, the preference labels are derived from two categories - `new_comment`, and `new_message`:

<img className="full-mobile" src="/docs/uploads/categories_preferences.png" />

If you build a custom UI or integrate these preferences into your existing settings screen, you can use the [notification preferences API endpoint](http://localhost:3000/docs/rest-api/reference#put-preferences).

## Coming soon

Shortly, categories are going to enable you to

- Drill down into analytics
- Select templates
